place is legit the best breakfast place in San Francisco. I was blown away this afternoon with my Pork Benedict. All the flavors worked together so well. I was basically licking my plate, that's how great it was. My friend got the Denver Omelette and the eggs were extremely fluffy and perfect. Not to mention, the service here is phenomenal! Seriously, don't pass this place up.\",\n"," \"Came on a Saturday morning at 10am and was seated right away. People started to trickle in after we have arrived and the place quickly filled up at around 10:45am. Despite this cute quaint breakfast shop, the food did not live up to expectations. The presentation of the dishes were very nice, but the taste was disappointing. I ordered the California omelette and the egg was bland and spongey. It came with chicken apple sausages, green onions, garlic, tomatoes, avocado, and cheddar cheese. I asked for no tomatoes, but when the dish came...it had so many green onions I couldn't taste anything else. The dish comes with either hash browns or potato medley and toast. Despite opening at 8am, they were out of potato medley...at 10am. The hash brown was also super oily. The dishes were also not served together and my boyfriend's dish didn't come until my food was cold. He ordered the avocado smoked salmon Benedict and it was also not that warm. His hash browns were also really oily. Servers also didn't refill our water until we asked for the check and were ready to leave. They checked in quite a bit, and it was honestly excessive. Honestly did not enjoy my experience. The food really was underwhelming and I am not coming back. It was also fairly expensive (typical for brunch though).\",\n"," \"First time here and it was pretty good. I had the California omelet , angel wings and steak and eggs. Sticking to low carb meals lol. The steak n eggs isn't anything special you can't find anywhere else. The Cali omelete and angel wings are really good. Just heads up the wings would go great with rice. The place is more of a Asian American fusion restaurant. At the moment no dinner yet which I can't wait when they do to see what they will be serving. The decor is ok. A bit of old school style but hey as long the food is good is what matters. Oh, I love the plates too. So pretty. Also don't forget their yummy fresh squeezed OJ must get. Overall we really enjoyed ourselves. The service is great \\xa0like any good mom and pop store. I Definitely recommend and will be back to this place.\",\n"," \"We had lunch here and loved everything about this place (including my foodie husband and picky toddlers). Staff were super friendly and accommodating, place looks lovely and clean. Food and drinks were absolutely delicious and they had plenty of options for everyone (American breakfast, Asian inspired). We had Jamie's combo, blueberry pancakes, salmon Benedict, yellow curry, crab cake bites and drinks. Many thanks for your lovely food and service. We will definitely come back next time we're in the city.PS: We loved the food presentation. I truly appreciate and admire little presentation touches. It makes a diffeeence too\",\n"," 'Wondered on Yelp to check others reviews for a new breakfast spot since I normally cook my own breakfast but why not treat myself for a breakfast after Christmas Day. Needed something different and Jamie is the place for a good new breakfast experience. First I tried the crab fried rice. So divine and yummy. I was experiencing an extended Christmas gift. The California omelette so soft and tasty with avocado on top. The 3 cheese omelette was so fluffy and had bacon inside . The potatoes were soft and not soggy. Yelpers are Santa Helpers.',\n"," \"November 6th 2021 10:30am I came here on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy. There was plenty of seating and about 2 other parties there besides us. We were seated promptly and given a paper menu.I got the Ocean Benedict and it looked appetizing but just a tad bit on the smaller portion size. I wish there was either more fruit or the hash brown was bigger. The ketchup is in these vintage glass bottles which I can understand for the aesthetic but it was extremely difficult to get any ketchup out even after slapping the bottle on the bottom so many times. The food itself was okay. The description of the Ocean Benedict included crab meat but I didn't taste or find any crab meat in my Benedict or maybe it was too subtle. There were some shells in my Benedict I also bit into and hurt my teeth on. The hash hashbrowns were crispy just like I requested them. Overall food was about 3.5 stars.Service was attentive since the waitress checked on us about 4 times. It was a little excessive but at least they did care about how we were and we also got refills on our water.\",\n"," \"My partner and I landed in San Francisco late one afternoon and we were SO hungry. We took BART and MUNI to our Airbnb, discovering that Jamie's Place was along the way. We hopped off the N train and stumbled into the empty restaurant with our luggage and tired bodies. Just the smell of Thai food was enough to wake us up as we drooled over the menu.I got the Pad Kee Mao (my favorite Thai dish) and it was ready so quickly! Honestly one of the best iterations I've ever tasted... So hot and fresh. The noodles were super soft, and the proportion of veggies was perfect. Everything was flavored wonderfully. I know Jamie's Place is marketed as brunch but honestly get their Thai food. It was just what we needed.\",\n"," \"My second time coming here and this is a great brunch spot! The first time I came here was on a Sunday brunch and we didn't have to wait too long for our seats! The food was so delicious, the staff was so sweet! Today (Thursday) we went more around 1, so there was only one other table. The food, again, was delicious! And the owners are so so sweet! Even the other table was leaving with an abundant of compliments to them! I definitely will continue to come here! It is a but pricey, but worth it (: food and presentation on point!\",\n"," \"I am obsessed with this mom and pop style restaurant.Jamie's place is set in the Inner Sunset of San Francisco. My friends and I made our way to this establishment along with a friend that was visiting from SoCal. We wanted to help a family restaurant but that also had brunch options as well as other type of Asian food on the list. Here comes Jamie's Place. They had a fantastic selection of breakfast (eggs, potatoes, and such) as well as brunch (omelets and benedicts) for the savory folks. There's also Thai pan fried noodles, if brunch isn't what you seek.The friend that recommended this place noted that some of the restaurant was popular for their Mascarpone Pancakes ($16) and Green Tea French Toast ($13), both of which were ordered by the friend that connected us. I ordered a Smoked Salmon Benedict ($18) and a Thai Iced Tea ($4), which was very tasty, but which I didn't finish because I wasn't the most hungry. I would argue that they have a great selection of items, but none which seemed to stray from the tried-and-true items.They deliver the plates in perfectly instagram-worthy style and just the right portion of food where you're not bloated and in need of a nap (although, additional rest is always encouraged and important).The staff was very delightful and despite the language barrier, was able to help address all questions and made sure that our coffee and water was replenished. They did, accidentally charge an extra item on our menu, but when we discovered it, they gave us cash for the difference, so not to mess up the electronic bill that was already generated.The restaurant is a good sized, but with limited seating for large parties. Would advise reserving a spot if you have more than 4 and are coming at a peak time.Also, it looks like they have a fantastic lunch and dinner menu as well. Must come back.\",\n"," 'we came in here on a whim and had a great experience! Pretty quiet and lots of space which was nice. The service was great and everyone was very kind and helpful.
